# Data-Driven Personal Loan Campaign Analysis
Supervised Learning Classification Project: AllLife Bank Personal Loan Prediction 
I recently worked on a Machine Learning classification project to help AllLife Bank identify potential customers who are more likely to accept a personal loan offer.
Project Overview:
Problem: The bank wants to convert more liability customers (depositors) into personal loan customers to boost loan revenue.
Objective: Build a model to predict which customers are likely to take a personal loan based on attributes like income, credit card spending, family size, education, and mortgage.
Key Insights & Results:
Achieved 98.9% accuracy using Random Forest
Identified key factors influencing loan acceptance
Conducted Chi-Square tests and visualized customer segmentation
Compared multiple ML models (Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)
Impact:
1. Helps the marketing team target high-potential customers
2. Improves loan campaign success rates
3. Enhances data-driven decision-making in banking
